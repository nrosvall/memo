# Memo - Unix-style note-taking software

Memo is a Unix-style note-taking software for POSIX compatible systems.
At the moment it's tested on GNU/Linux and on FreeBSD, 
but it should be very portable for other platforms. Memo also works 
under Cygwin, but it's not actively tested under it.

Memo is licenced under the GPL.
