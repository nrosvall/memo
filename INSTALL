How to install Memo from source code

    To compile and install Memo, you will need fairly modern
    C compiler which supports C99 standard. You will also
    need GNU Make program. Make is not mandatory, but makes
    compiling and installing Memo easier.

    1) Extract the source code archive e.g memo-1.0.tar.gz 
    2) Move to the Memo source code directory 
    3) Type make. This will compile Memo.
    4) Type make install as root. This will install Memo to
    /usr/local/bin and memo.1 manpage to /usr/local/share/man/man1/memo.1.gz
    5) Run Memo. For example: memo -a "My first note"

    Compile Memo without GNU Make.
    
	While it's possible to compile Memo without GNU Make program,
	you will have to manually install the memo binary and the
	manpage.

	Compile command (assuming GCC is the C compiler in use): 
	gcc -o memo memo.c

    If compiled natively on Windows MinGW is needed as well as Pcre
    library for POSIX regular expression support.

	To install memo binary: cp memo /usr/local/bin/
	To install memo.1 manpage: 
	   cp memo.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
	   gzip /usr/local/share/man/man1/memo.1
